Of course you can run it through docker using the parameters -p 8080:8080 and -p 9090:8080.
But it&amp;rsquo;s painful everytime you will run it since you will have to change each port on your localhost.</description></item><item><title>Contributors</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/about/contributors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/about/contributors/</guid><description>Contributors ðŸš§</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Jenkins</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/01-introductiontojenkins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/01-introductiontojenkins/</guid><description>What is Jenkins? Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.
Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
It also allow you to automate your deployment starting from lower environment such as:
graph LR; A[DEV] --> B(QA) --> C[STAGING] --> D[PROD] It allows you to define / create scripts by using Groovy Scripts to create logical workflow that you would use to automate your build / testing / delivery or deployment.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Jenkins</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/introductiontojenkins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/introductiontojenkins/</guid><description>What is Jenkins?

According to GitLab, &amp;ldquo;DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers&amp;rdquo;
Common misconceptions about DevOps One of the most common misconceptions is that DevOps is a specific job title or position within a business enterprise. In truth, DevOps is not a job title.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Setup Docker Compose</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/02-jenkinssetupdocker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/02-jenkinssetupdocker/</guid><description>For local development, we can use jenkins thru docker-compose to quickly fire up our Jenkins Server.
Will use the latest nginx:alpine and jenkins/jenkins:lts lts image as it&amp;rsquo;s latest version.
In real world, it is not recommended to run jenkins without a reverse proxy due to the limitations of it&amp;rsquo;s web server configuration, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that it would not work. But it will leave your jenkins server VULNERABLE and prone to error.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Setup Docker Compose</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/jenkinssetupdocker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/jenkinssetupdocker/</guid><description>For local development, we can use jenkins thru docker-compose to quickly fire up our Jenkins Server.

We will use the latest jenkins-controller jenkins/jenkins:lts as lts image version.
Do not use in production. If you want a production grade deployment. Kindly, refer to this repository https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts
It is fairly recommended to plan ahead the sustainability of the Jenkins Server deployment. As systems like Jenkins which is not designed to be scalable is highly prone to fail.</description></item><item><title>Jenkins Setup on Kubernetes</title><link>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/jenkinssetupk8s/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://devops.redopsbay.dev/cicd/jenkins/jenkinssetupk8s/</guid><description>For quick deployment, we can deploy jenkins server thru kubernetes cluster.
