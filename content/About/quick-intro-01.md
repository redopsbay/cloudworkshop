### Common misconceptions about DevOps

One of the most common misconceptions is that DevOps is a specific job title or position within a business enterprise. In truth, **DevOps** is not a job title. It is a way of life that transcends traditional silos.

DevOps encourages collaboration among improvement, operations, and different cross-practical groups. Instead of specializing in an unmarried DevOps engineer, companies need to aim to instill DevOps standards across all groups, fostering a subculture of shared responsibility and cooperation.

In short, DevOps is solely about automation like automating the deployment **process**. That's the word. **PROCESS**.
