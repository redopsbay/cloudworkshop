This is what traefik proxy comes in.\nScenario üòÅ For example, you have multiple docker services in your docker-compose file running multiple web applications or api endpoints and it\u0026rsquo;s both designed to run on port 8080.\n# In my case, I will use my personal domain `redopsbay.dev`. If you don\u0026#39;t have one. # you can always modify your `/etc/hosts` or `C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts` file to add entries like: # /etc/hosts or C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts # 127.0.0.1 api.example.org version: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; services: # Traefik proxy will be the frontend or edge router of your container services traefik-proxy: image: traefik:v3.0 container_name: traefik-proxy command: - --api.insecure=true - --providers.docker - --entrypoints.http.address=:80 # Expose port `80` on your machine ports: - \u0026#34;80:80\u0026#34; volumes: # give traefik-proxy access into docker.sock - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # `user-api` running port `8080` user-api: image: user-api:latest build: context: user dockerfile: Dockerfile container_name: user-api labels: - traefik.enable=true - traefik.http.services.user-api.loadbalancer.server.port=8000 - traefik.http.routers.user-api.rule=Host(`api.redopsbay.dev`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/user`) - traefik.http.routers.user-api.entrypoints=http - traefik.http.middlewares.user-api.stripprefix.prefixes=/user - traefik.http.routers.user-api.middlewares=user-api # using `http` entrypoint that utilizes port `80` ports: - 8000 # `product-api` running port `80` product-api: image: product-api:latest build: context: product dockerfile: Dockerfile container_name: product-api labels: - traefik.enable=true - traefik.http.services.product-api.loadbalancer.server.port=8000 - traefik.http.routers.product-api.rule=Host(`api.redopsbay.dev`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/product`) - traefik.http.routers.product-api.entrypoints=http - traefik.http.middlewares.product-api.stripprefix.prefixes=/product - traefik.http.routers.product-api.middlewares=product-api # using `http` entrypoint also that utilizes port `80` ports: - 8000 If you run and thru docker-compose up:\ndocker-compose up If you visit the url in my case it\u0026rsquo;s http://api.redopsbay.dev/user/1 \u0026amp; http://api.redopsbay.dev/product/3, the response will be:\n# http://api.redopsbay.dev/user/ {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;andres\u0026#34;} # http://api.redopsbay.dev/product/ {\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;testproduct\u0026#34;} That\u0026rsquo;s it!!! üëå\nNote: Traefik does not tied up only to a api development.

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.\nJenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.\nIt also allow you to automate your deployment starting from lower environment such as:\ngraph LR; A[DEV] --\u003e B(QA) --\u003e C[STAGING] --\u003e D[PROD] It allows you to define / create scripts by using Groovy Scripts to create logical workflow that you would use to automate your build / testing / delivery or deployment.\n"},{"uri":"https://devops.redopsbay.dev/kubernetes/","title":"Kubernetes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\nThis section covers basic demonstration about Kubernetes a container orchestrator.\n"},{"uri":"https://devops.redopsbay.dev/observability/","title":"Observability","tags":[],"description":"","content":"\nThis section covers basic demonstration about Observability.\n"},{"uri":"https://devops.redopsbay.dev/about/quick-intro-01/","title":"Quick Introduction To DevOps","tags":[],"description":"","content":"What is DevOps? According to GitLab, \u0026ldquo;DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers\u0026rdquo;\nCommon misconceptions about DevOps One of the most common misconceptions is that DevOps is a specific job title or position within a business enterprise. In truth, DevOps is not a job title. It is a way of life that transcends traditional silos.\nDevOps encourages collaboration among improvement, operations, and different cross-practical groups. Instead of specializing in an unmarried DevOps engineer, companies need to aim to instill DevOps standards across all groups, fostering a subculture of shared responsibility and cooperation.\nIn short, DevOps is solely about automation like automating the deployment process.
